# Secondary Indexes

## Making Querying Easier

!SLIDE bullets

# Secondary Indexes (2I)

* Search is too heavyweight (schemas, analyzers)
* Some problems are hard to solve with just keys
* Key-filters (list-keys) doesn't scale well
* DIY indexes are hard

!SLIDE bullets

# Design of 2I

* Defined as object metadata
* Stored on same vnodes as object
* Queries use "coverage" ops (like list-keys)

<div class="notes hidden">

Storing the index information as object metadata and in the same
vnodes as the object makes index creation, handoff and consistency
much simpler. However, it means that you have to query by hitting a
"covering set" of vnodes, that is, about 1/N of the vnodes in the
cluster are queried.

# Simple Equality Example

    @@@ sh
    $ export RIAK=http://localhost:8098/
    
    $ curl -X PUT \
      -H "x-riak-index-email_bin: sean@basho.com" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"name":"Sean","email":"sean@basho.com"}' \
      $RIAK/riak/p/sean

    $ curl $RIAK/buckets/p/index/email_bin/sean@basho.com
    {"keys":["sean"]}

# Equality + MapReduce

    @@@ sh
    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" $RIAK/mapred \
        -d @-    
    {"inputs":{
        "bucket":"p",
        "index":"email_bin",
        "key":"sean@basho.com"
        },
     "query":[
        {"map":{"name":"Riak.mapValuesJson",
                "language":"javascript",
                "keep":true}}
       ]}

    [{"name":"Sean","email":"sean@basho.com"}]

# Simple Range Example

# 2I Use-Cases

* Secondary lookups (non-key)
* High-cardinality relationships (1-MANY)
* Range scans
* Multi-valued fields

!SLIDE bullets incremental

# Not Yet Supported

* NO Multi-index queries
* NO Query language
* NO Sorting or pagination
* NO Other data-types (floats, dates)
* NO Native query over PBC (use mapred)
* Only on LevelDB backend

<div class="notes hidden">

For the first release, we decided to focus on correctness and
reliability at the expense of feature-completeness. Secondary indexes
will get continued attention following the 1.0 release.
